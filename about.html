                <p>Notice that the subpath defined above is “open”. It consists of just two line segments
                    and the end point is not connected back to the starting point. This means that it does
                    not enclose a region. The fill() method fills open subpaths by acting as if a straight
                    line connected the last point in the subpath to the first point in the subpath. That is
                    why the code above fills a triangle, but strokes only two sides of the triangle.
                </p>

                <p>   If you wanted to stroke all three sides of the triangle above, you would call the close
                    Path() method to connect the end point of the subpath to the start point. (You could
                    also call lineTo(100,100), but then you end up with three line segments that share a
                    start and end point but are not truly closed. When drawing with wide lines, the visual
                    results are better if you use closePath()
